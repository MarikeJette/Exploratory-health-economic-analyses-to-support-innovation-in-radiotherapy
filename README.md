# Exploratory health economic analyses to support innovation in radiotherapy

We designed a flexible, multi-purpose tool for exploratory health economic analyses using the Shiny package 1.8.0 for R. The web-based tool allows users to flexibly explore the (extra) costs and effects needed for MRgRT compared to conventional treatment. 

We refer to conventional treatment as image-guided radiation therapy (without plan adaptation) on a linear accelerator with cone-beam CT. 

The tool intentionally does not target a specific indication or patient population upfront; instead, it is designed to be multi-purpose, allowing users to enter data for their specific situation of interest. 

By default, Dutch costs are used. The cost are, where possible, derived from the Dutch costing manual. Other default inputs reflect realistic estimates from Radboudumcâ€™s clinical experience
